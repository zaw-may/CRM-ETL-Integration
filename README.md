## Overview

This repository demonstrates a practical ETL pipeline that extracts CRM data from HubSpot using the official HubSpot API and HubSpot CLI, then loads the data into a SQL Server database.

The pipeline is designed to support reporting and analytics use cases and can be extended for automation, incremental loads, and integration with BI tools such as Power BI.

This project is intended for data professionals interested in building and maintaining CRM data pipelines.
